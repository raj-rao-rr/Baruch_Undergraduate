**C++ code to assigned HW problems for MTH 4300 taken at Baruch College Spring 2020**

This course is intended to be a sequel to MTH 3300 and focuses on the notion of classes, along with the concepts of pointers, inheritance, and polymorphism. The implementation of classes in a practical setting, such as scientific computing, quantitative finance, or Windows programming, will be part of the course.

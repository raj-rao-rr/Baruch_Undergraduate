**C++ code to assigned HW problems for MTH 5500 taken at Baruch College Spring 2020**

This is a “capstone” course for financial engineering majors which brings to life their sophisticated mathematical background (in probability, stochastic processes, statistics, and financial mathematics) by connecting it to hands-on analysis of data and simulation techniques needed for real world financial engineering applications. Course topics include time series analysis, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, hidden Markov models, portfolio risk management.
